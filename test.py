DLP Incident Response Enhancement via AI-Powered File Analysis
Overview

This project aims to enhance the incident response playbook for the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) team by integrating an AI-powered file analysis module.

The objective is to automate the extraction of meaningful summaries and insights from complex file types — such as binary files, compressed archives (e.g., ZIP), emails, and other attachments — captured by Symantec DLP. The enhancement leverages a GPU-hosted Large Language Model (LLM) for deep content analysis.

Analysts interact with this system directly from the XSOAR platform via a dedicated case layout tab, enabling seamless, one-click invocation of the backend AI workflow. The results are presented in the same interface, ensuring minimal disruption to the analyst's workflow while significantly improving the analytical depth of incident handling.
Architecture

The solution consists of the following components:

    XSOAR Platform (Analyst Interface):

        Acts as the frontend for the DLP team analysts.

        A dedicated case layout tab is created.

        Analysts initiate the analysis by clicking a button embedded in the layout.

        An automation script in XSOAR handles triggering the backend.

    API Gateway:

        The automation script makes a call to a GPU-hosted API endpoint.

        The call passes the Incident ID and relevant context data.

    GPU-Hosted Backend Processing Server:

        Receives the incident context.

        Uses internal logic to:

            Query Symantec DLP using the Incident ID.

            Download associated files.

            Classify file types.

            Preprocess file content.

            Interact with the LLM for summary generation.

        Sends back a summary and metadata as an API response.

    LLM Engine:

        Hosted on a GPU-optimized environment.

        Processes a dynamically constructed prompt, combining structured and unstructured content.

        Returns meaningful, actionable summaries.

    Output Rendering:

        The summary and other outputs are parsed from the API response.

        Displayed back to the analyst in the XSOAR case layout tab.

        Optional routing to email or other modules for notification and escalation.

Process Flow

    Trigger from XSOAR:

        The analyst clicks the analysis button in the case layout.

        XSOAR automation collects the Incident ID and context data.

    Backend Invocation:

        An API call is made to the backend with the Incident ID.

        The server queries Symantec DLP, downloads and classifies files.

    Preprocessing:

        Headers and body content are extracted.

        Files are normalized and prepared for LLM ingestion.

    LLM Analysis:

        A prompt module, maintained in a code repository, dynamically generates a query for the LLM.

        The LLM processes the content and generates insights or a summary.

    Postprocessing:

        The LLM output is cleaned, structured, and tagged for usability.

        Metadata and summary are bundled in the response.

    Response Handling:

        The XSOAR layout receives the response.

        The output is displayed within the summary tab of the incident layout.

        Optional delivery via email module or other downstream workflows.

Key Features

    Integrates seamlessly into existing DLP playbooks within XSOAR.

    No manual file uploads required – fully automated from Symantec DLP ingestion.

    Real-time API-driven interaction between XSOAR and backend AI.

    GPU-hosted LLM enables deep contextual understanding of file content.

    Outputs are made directly actionable for analysts inside their workflow.

Technical Notes

    Automation Script: Written in XSOAR to initiate API calls with appropriate context.

    Prompt Construction: Modularized in a backend code repository to allow easy tuning and scaling.

    File Sources: Pulled dynamically from Symantec DLP based on incident linkage.

    Security: API gateway is secured with authentication to ensure data integrity and privacy.
